## 🧩 Overview
The **Sales Prediction Dashboard** is a web-based application designed to analyze and predict future product sales using historical transaction data.  
It integrates data visualization, demand forecasting, and predictive analytics to support business decision-making processes.

This project focuses on building a structured **database system**, applying **data normalization & denormalization**, and developing an **interactive dashboard** that displays real-time sales insights.

## 🎯 Mission & Objectives

### **Mission**
To provide a data-driven system that enables companies to visualize sales performance and predict future demand accurately.

### **Objectives**
- Develop a relational database optimized for storing sales, product, and transaction data.
- Implement data preprocessing, normalization, and denormalization for efficient analytics.
- Create a machine learning–based prediction model for forecasting future sales.
- Design an interactive dashboard to present analytical and predictive insights visually.

## 🧱 Database Design

### **1. Logical Database Design**
The logical design defines the normalized structure of entities such as **Customers**, **Products**, **Orders**, **Payments**, **Coupons**, and **Staffs**, maintaining referential integrity and eliminating redundancy.

### **2. Denormalization Process**
After defining the logical schema, the design is denormalized to optimize analytical queries and dashboard performance.  
Denormalization merges frequently joined tables, simplifies queries, and improves access speed for predictive models.
